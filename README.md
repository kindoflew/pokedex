# Pokedex

This started as an exercise in fetching and "massaging" data and 
turned into an exercise in being less bad at CSS. Although, the CSS *is*
poorly organized (I'll probably, maybe clean it up eventually).
Built with [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) and [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). 

Link coming soon.

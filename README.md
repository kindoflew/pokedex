# Pokedex

This started as a learning exercise in fetching data and formatting nicely
and turned into a learning exercise in being less bad at CSS. Although, the CSS is
poorly organized (I'll probably, maybe clean it up eventually).
Built with [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) and [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). 

Link coming soon.
